      <p>A visibly drunk person makes a sexual advance on you. You're interested. What do you do?</p>
      <a href="#">Go along with it.</a>
      <a href="#">Ask for their number.</a>
    </div>
    <div class="wrong-1">
      <p class="wrong-text">That doesn't seem right...a person under the influence of a substance cannot consent</p>
      <input type="button" class="start-over" value="Start Over" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="gate gate-2">
    <div class="q-2">
      <p class="correct-text">That's right - Get their digits and maybe hangout another time! :)</p>
      <p>Later in the night, you're provocatively dancing with someone in sexy clothes who seems to be into you. The person is sober. You'd like to initiate sex. What do you do?</p>

  <div class="gate gate-3">
    <div class="q-3">
      <p class="correct-text">Correct - consent in one activity does not automatically give you consent in another. When in doubt, always ask to make sure!</p>
      <p>You asked if they were interested, but they didn't respond. What do you do next?</p>
      <a href="#">Ask again until you receive a yes.</a>
      <a href="#">Leave - if they change their mind they will come look for you</a>
    </div>
    <div class="wrong-3">
