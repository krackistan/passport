          <h2>1. No touching without explicit, verbal permission.</h2>
          <p>Our home is a safe space where we can express our sexuality however we like. Don't confuse that with consent. If we were asking for it, you would hear us. Don't ruin our safe space - if you want anything, just ask. Always make sure your partner are sober, and silence means no. Non-negotiable.</p>
